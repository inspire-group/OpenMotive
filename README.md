## AMBER safety application for internet-connected vehicles

This program takes a vehicle license plate as an input and checks the camera for any plate that matches.
It has 3 modes:
- Raspberry Pi: all the computation is done on the raspberry pi,
- Cloud: all the computation is done on the cloud,
- Both: the computation is efficiently divided between the raspberry pi and the cloud.
