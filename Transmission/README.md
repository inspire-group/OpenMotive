# Vehicle Transmission Sports and Efficiency Modes Application

This program provides the user with knowledge about the optimal Engine RPMs at which
the vehicle must switch gears for maximum acceleration (Sports Mode) and at which the
vehicle must drive for maximum fuel efficiency (Efficiency Mode).

There are 2 phases: training and testing.
- During the training phase, the user will be asked to switch gears and drive at
specific Engine RPMs in order for the program to extract the RPM data combined
with the speed and fuel consumption. The program will then determine the optimal
values for Sports Mode and Efficiency Mode.
- During the testing phase, the user will automatically be given the optimal
Engine RPMs at which the vehicle must be driven for optimal functionality in
each mode.
